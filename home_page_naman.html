        <h1>Coffee Lover Project</h1>
        <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.

Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.It is one of the most popular drinks in the world and can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste or enhance the flavor. It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert, like doughnuts.</p>
<p style ="font-size:25px">Here are the basic steps to make coffee-assuming you're not making it with an automatic coffee machine (in which case, you'd follow manufacturers' guidelines):</p>
<ol>
  <li style="font-size:20px">Line the basket of your coffee maker with a filter. Grind coffee beans to medium or medium-fine grind size. Bring filtered water to a boil, then let it sit for a minute.</li>
  <li style="font-size:20px">Pour enough water into the filter to wet it completely, and let it drain into your cup or coffee pot. Discard the water.</li>
  <li style="font-size:20px">Measure the ground coffee into the wet filter. Pour in enough water to wet the ground beans and drain into your cup or coffee pot, then pour in the rest of the water,</li>
</ol>
